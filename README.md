# Signed Spiral Unification
![CI](https://github.com/thegardeners/signed_spiral_unification/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)


This repository introduces the **Signed Spiral Theorem** as a foundational model for unifying:

- Quantum Mechanics (Standard Model)
- String Theory
- Mass-Energy Equivalence (E=mcÂ²)
 
## Highlights

- ðŸŒŒ Spiral-based derivation of energy, mass, and identity
- ðŸ”¥ Pytest suite for validating waveform-based physics
- ðŸ“Š Allure reports for visualization
- ðŸ§ª Self-validating universal test runner

Run:

```bash
poetry install
pytest --alluredir=allure-results
allure serve allure-results
```
